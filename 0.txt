The Hong Kong tourist board has partnered with Hong Kong International Airport (HKG) and home airline Cathay Pacific to offer North American travelers a limited batch of cut-price airfares to the city.

The campaign to celebrate the easing of travel restrictions in the region is part of a plan to give away 700,000 subsidized tickets globally; it began slowly rolling out country by country in March.

The North American offering is currently underway with Cathay Pacific. Successful applicants will pay only the taxes and surcharges for their tickets. To put this in context, roundtrip fares from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to HKG typically start around $2,300 dollars with taxes and surcharges totaling around $350 of that amount. This means that the subsidized ticket offer could save you at least $1,800 on your ticket or even more during busier periods.

However, you'll need to act fast if you want to benefit â€” the airline will contact applicants on May 17 at 5:00 p.m. PST/8:00 p.m. EST, via email where they will receive an access link. You'll then be able to use the link until the sales close on May 23 or until all tickets have sold out. Tickets will be available on a first-come-first-served basis, so keep an eye on you emails for the access link if you don't want to miss out.

To be in with a chance, you must sign up as a member of Cathay Pacific's Asia Miles loyalty program by using the link on the airline's World of Winners page here.
