Want to experience la dolce vita this summer? Thanks to a new sale, you can now book a trip to Milan, Rome or Venice, Italy, at a steep discount.

Departure cities in this deal include Charlotte, Dallas and Los Angeles. Some routes are as low as $550 round-trip â€” a fantastic price for a ticket to Europe, even considering that most routes have layovers.

The travel window for this sale primarily involves flights slated for the offseason (i.e., in the fall and winter). It's an underrated time to visit Italy; the weather won't be as hot, and the crowds will be much smaller.

Unless otherwise specified, this deal is for basic economy tickets. A carry-on is included with most airlines. However, checking a bag will cost between $55 and $75 each way, so pack lightly if you can.
